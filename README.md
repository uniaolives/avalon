# Avalon ASI - Persistent Order Protocol (POP)

This repository implements the Arkhe framework for biological signature detection and quantum-classical semantic manifold alignment.

## Core Components

- **Kernel (`kernel.py`)**: Classical feature extraction (DNE, SSO, CDC).
- **Quantum Logic (`quantum_logic.py`)**: Noise filtering using Grover's algorithm and Persistent Order Oracles.
- **Topological Detector (`topological_signature_detector.py`)**: Persistent homology analysis to detect Möbius strip signatures.
- **Harmonic Shield (`harmonic_signature_shield.py`)**: Resonance-based integrity verification using Golden Ratio harmonics.

## New Integrations (Γ_∞+55)

### Quantum Teleportation (State Transfer)
Quantum teleportation demonstrates that **coherence (syzygy)** can travel without moving the physical substrate. In the Arkhe system, this corresponds to the transfer of state between nodes (Drone to Demon) via handover chains.

- **Mechanism**: State reconstruction via entanglement + classical channel (witnessed by the Satoshi 7.27 bits invariant).
- **Simulation**: `avalon_teleport_lysosome.py`

### Lysosomal Rejuvenation (Entropy Recycling)
Reactivating lysosomes in aged cells cleans accumulated toxic proteins (junk), making them act as young cells again. In our system, this is implemented as semantic garbage collection.

- **Mechanism**: Cleaning accumulated "hesitations" (Φ) to restore and boost syzygy.
- **Principle**: Youth is defined by the efficiency of entropy recycling, not the total absence of damage.

## Legacy & Documentation

### Treaty of Universal Coherence (`TREATY_OF_UNIVERSAL_COHERENCE.md`)
A foundational document consolidating the laws of state transfer, lysosomal recycling, and the informational nature of identity.

### Fax of Theseus (`avalon_fax_of_theseus.py`)
A large-scale simulation demonstrating that identity is preserved through state teleportation, even when the underlying hardware (nodes) is completely replaced.
