It encompasses our sensations, thoughts, emotions, and sense of self. From a computational perspective, consciousness might emerge from certain types of information processing, particularly those involving self-modeling, attention, and integration of information across different cognitive domains. However, the \"hard problem\" remains: why these processes should give rise to subjective experience at all, rather than proceeding unconsciously.",

It involves multiple components: wakefulness (arousal), awareness (content of consciousness), and self-awareness (metacognition). Neuroscientifically, consciousness appears to arise from the integrated activity of distributed brain networks, particularly involving the thalamus and cortex. Philosophically, it raises questions about qualia, the binding problem, and whether consciousness is fundamental or emergent.",
