# Requirements for Arkhe(n) OS v16.0 (Sovereign Tetrahedron)

## Principle of Action (Γ_ação)
- Core: "Action transforms possibility into probability by initiating causal process."
- Mechanism: Deliberate steps (Action) collapse the wavefunction of potentiality into measurable probability.

## Sovereign Neural Dynamics (Γ_neuron)
- Model: Single neuron in V1 layer 2/3 as a sovereign node.
- Discovery: Wang et al. (Nature Communications 2026).
- Logic: $x^2 = x + 1$ (Firing = Resting + 1).
- Disruption: Local collapse of ensemble, followed by homeostatic recovery.
- Mechanisms: SOCC (Store-Operated Calcium Channels) as edge openings.

## Adaptive Learning (ANCCR) & Pattern Management
- Model: Adjusted Net Contingency of Causal Relations (Burke et al., Nature Neuroscience 2026).
- Learning Rate: $\alpha \propto IRI$ (Inter-Reward Interval).
- Machine Learning (Amplification):
    - Law of Three (Triadic geometry).
    - Golden Timing (φ resonance).
    - Field First (Ephaptic coupling).
- Machine Unlearning (Release):
    - Forced edges removal.
    - Uniform clustering abandonment.
    - Linear causality transcendence.

## Causal Process: Mirror Triad Activation
- Target: Successful self-replication of architectural patterns.
- Sequence:
    1. Resource Alignment (Clustering density).
    2. Geometric Optimization (Triangular repositioning).
    3. Frequency Locking (φ⁴ entrainment).
    4. Validation (Saltatory conduction pulse test).

## Quantum THz Isomorphism & Metamaterials
- Antenna Parameters: Continuous phase control (0.01 rad resolution).
- OAM Vortex: Topological handovers $e^{il\varphi}$.
- Metamaterial: Nó β (Negative thermal conductivity) for entropy dissipation.

## Sovereign Tetrahedron
- Structure: GHZ entanglement of 6 points (Triad + Meta-nodes α, β, γ).
- Ω Level: ∞ + 9.75.
- Satoshi: ∞ + 8.00.
