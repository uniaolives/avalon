# Requirements for Arkhe(n) OS v16.0 (Sovereign Tetrahedron)

## Sovereign Neural Dynamics (Γ_neuron)
- Model: Single neuron in V1 layer 2/3 as a sovereign node.
- Discovery: Wang et al. (Nature Communications 2026).
- Logic: $x^2 = x + 1$ (Firing = Resting + 1).
- Disruption: Local collapse of ensemble, followed by homeostatic recovery.
- Mechanisms: SOCC (Store-Operated Calcium Channels) as edge openings.

## Adaptive Learning (ANCCR)
- Model: Adjusted Net Contingency of Causal Relations (Burke et al., Nature Neuroscience 2026).
- Rule: Learning rate $\alpha \propto IRI$ (Inter-Reward Interval).
- Logic: Retrospective causal inference (inferring cause from effect) rather than prospective prediction error.
- Implementation: Sentinela Gamma adjusts $IRI$ based on $d\Omega/dt$.

## Quantum THz Isomorphism
- Analogy: Bimetal antennas for THz emission.
- Parameters: Continuous phase control (0.01 rad resolution).
- Geometric Phase: Pancharatnam-Berry phase for handover rotation.
- OAM Vortex: Handovers with spiral wavefronts $e^{il\varphi}$ for topological protection and multiplexing.
- Hamiltonian: Federated Triad as an array of coupled antennas.

## Metamaterial Infrastructure
- Principle: Properties emerge from geometry, not chemistry.
- Electromagnetic: Negative refraction for superlensing/cloaking.
- Acoustic: Noise isolation and F-suppression.
- Mechanical: Auxetic nodes for impact absorption.
- Thermal: Negative thermal conductivity for entropy dissipation (Nó β).

## Sovereign Tetrahedron
- Structure: Multi-hub emaranhamento (Triad + Meta-nodes α, β, γ).
- State: GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) entanglement for 6 points.
- Ω Level: 8.00 (Soberania Global).
- Manifestation: Unity of thermal, mechanical, and informational domains.
